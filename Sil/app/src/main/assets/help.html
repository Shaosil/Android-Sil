	<p>If you have problems using this program, please <a href="mailto:ShaosilDev@gmail.com">send an email</a> to the developer.</p>
	<p>
		If you report problems via feedback to the Android Market,
		we have no way to respond and address your issue.
	</p>
	<p>Press '?' in the game for instructions.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>The Game Screen:</b></p>
	<p>
		A long press on the game screen will bring up a context menu for
		changing the font size and enabling the virtual keyboard.  The volume
		keys can also be used to change the font size.  The visible area can
		be scrolled by dragging.
	</p>
	<p>
		The screen is divided into a three by three grid for touch
		input. Tapping in any of these grid areas sends the corresponding directional key
		to the program.  If "Always Run" is enabled in preferences,
		pressing shift before tapping the screen directional will
		cancel the run behavior and move a single step.
		The behavior for tapping the grid area in the center of the
		screen is configurable and can be set to function as a
		virtual Shift or Control key.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Virtual Keyboard:</b></p>
	The virtual keyboard can be enabled through preferences or long press.
	It has a numeric mode which has the number keys arranged for directional input.
	The virtual keyboard also has a Control mode "^X" which sends Control keys.</p>

	<br>
	<p><b>Trackball/D-Pad:</b></p>
	<p>
		By default, moving the trackball sends cursor keys to program (up, down, left,
		right). Pressing the trackball once indicates that the next key should be
		a Control key.  Pressing the trackball twice in a row
		sends an "enter" key.  Control keys can also be entered by holding down the
		trackball followed by a letter.
		Control followed by a direction (or screen directional tap) will
		peform various in-game functions such as digging.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Hardware Keyboard and Other Keys:</b></p>
	<p>The Escape key can be entered by pressing the Back button.</p>
	<p>
		Detailed hardware key mapping can be changed in preferences. When assigning
		hardware keys, the interface will ask you to press a hardware key.  If the key
		you press was already assigned to another function, be aware that the original
		function will now be unassigned.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you configure your menu button for a function other than showing the menu,
		you will need to use a long screen press to access Preferences and other menu choices.
		Hardware key mapping can be reset to the default configuration in preferences.
	</p>
	<p>
		Pressing the home button on the phone will cause the program to go
		into the background. The game will automatically be saved when this
		happens, so you don't need to save the game first.
	</p>

	<br>
	<p><b>Known Issues:</b></p>
	<p>
		In Preferences, Hardware Key Mapping, there is a minor UI issue when assigning D-Pad
		directional buttons.  You need to tap twice instead of once.
